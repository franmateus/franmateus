### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m a data scientist specialized in Time Series Forecasting and Linear Optimization.

- IÂ´m currently working on building deep learning models for time series forecasting with Temporal Fusion Transformers.

- I'm also delving into MS Azure, GCP and AWS cloud computing platforms.

- My next step will be to find out whatÂ´s new in Large Language Models.
